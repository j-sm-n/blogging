# Review of: [Part 1: Introduction and Installation (Go)](https://golangbot.com/golang-tutorial-part-1-introduction-and-installation/) by Naveen Ramanathan

### Three Things I Liked

1. Starting the first graph with what it is we're about to talk about is a great way to start.

2. Liked how we're told the overall benefit of Golang right at the beginning.

3. Liked the idea of breaking things up into multiple parts for easier reading.

### Three Things I'd Do Differently

1. Explain why Go being compiled to native binary is an advantage over languages like JavaScript and nodejs.

2. If you're having people install stuff, it's always nice to include little screenshots of some of the steps.

3. If you mention pros of using something, only seems fair to also try and cons (as I'm sure there's always going to be some).
