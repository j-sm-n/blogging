# Review of: [I just asked 23,000 developers what they think of JavaScript. Hereâ€™s what I learned.](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-just-asked-23-000-developers-what-they-think-of-javascript-heres-what-i-learned-9a06b61998fa) by Sacha Greif

### Three Things I Liked

1. LOVE how Sacha broke down the big takeaways from the survey into bite-sized chunks with corresponding charts to display results.

2. Sacha was good at not letting data mislead people with false positives.

3. Like the "What's Next" section at the end.

### Three Things I'd Do Differently

1. Why is the survey unique?

2. Possibly explain what some of the technologies are good for, like GraphQL and Vue.js.

3. Didn't really offer differences in React as a library and Angular as a framework.
