# Review of: [Demystifying Recursion](https://medium.com/turingschool/demystifying-recursion-9a4de8ceeb7e) by Ali Schlereth

### Three Things I Liked

1. I love the idea of explaining the origin of a word that explains a method of writing code, etc. In this post, Ali breaks down what 'recursion' means by breaking down its grammatical origins.

2. Lots of visual examples were great.

3. Include a summary and break things down into a few short bullet points.

### Three Things I'd Do Differently

1. If possible, show a process in smaller chunks and with animated gifs. Easier to visualize.

2. Avoid introducing the idea of another coding term without explaining it. Example: A 'pointer' will make sense to most seasoned developers, but a newbie will most likely not get what that means. If it's vital to explain it for the rest of the post, briefly explain it. If it isn't, leave it out (I would have left it out here). Same with "heap".

3. If you compare different types of the thing you're explaining, make sure to include key differences like pros and cons to different approaches or why something is even used in the first place. Would have loved some reasoning as to why recursion is a tool to use instead of iteration.
